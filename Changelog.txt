v0.4b:
- Fixed crash when browsing hard disks with only directories at a certain level (and no games)

- Fixed crash when launching games

v0.2b:
- Save button added to configuration
- Configuration checks for changes before saving, and before leaving the page
- You can adjust the refresh rate at which data.xml is refreshed from the XK3Y
- List item sizes are increased from 36 pixels to 48 pixels. Font size is also increased
- Tiles now start the animation at a random position
- Loading of the coverwall should be a lot faster now, since images are downloaded in a seperate thread (use BitmapImage instead of ImageUri)
- Scrolling of the coverwall is easier now, since you can now also start scrolling on the tiles itself (Tap event instead of Click, doh)
- Fixed a crash when loading a game. Also fixed an issue with the gamecount
